# Carbon Offset Marketplace

Our app is a platform for companies any entity to (1) obtain funding for new green projects and (2) further monetise existing green projects that have already began consistently removing CO2 from environment.

The focus is primarily on the voluntary market where anyone can fund new projects or support existing projects by buying carbon credits sold by these companies.

We are not focusing on compliance market to facilitate the trading of carbon credits b/w companies who have hit their carbon credit cap set by govt and want to buy carbon credits from other companies with surplus carbon credits (companies whose carbon credits are below the cap set by govt).
